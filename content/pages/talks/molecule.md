## Testing Ansible Roles with Molecule (Ton Kersten) ##

When writing Ansible roles it is an absolute must to test these in
different environments and on different operating systems. As you
can imagine, this can be a rather tedious task. But luckily there is
Molecule. Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing
of Ansible roles and provides support for testing with multiple
instances, operating systems and distributions.  
Ton is absolutely not a Molecule guru, but using Molecule turned out
to more difficult than expected. This presentation is about his
experiences and what pitfalls he encountered, thus preventing you
from running into the same irritation, frustration and hurray loops.

life. He enjoys good food, beer and whisky.
