# Abstract
In this session we will learn how to use Git, starting with the basics and
gradually move up to some more advanced commands and usages. During the
session we learn about a small set of commands and the theory behind them,
after which a small exercise is presented so you can try it out for
yourself (if you bring a laptop), before moving to the next part of
commands and theory.
