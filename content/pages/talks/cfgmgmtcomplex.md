## Dealing with complexity and abstractions in config management (Simon Peeters) ###

The world is complex, so are our systems, and so are are config management tools.

In a world where less sysadmins maintain more systems, how can we prevent ourselves from having to deal with all the complexities of all these systems?
And if we don't deal with the complexity ourselves, where does it go?

This talk will try to share some ideas on making future lazy you be thankful to past you for not having to deal with unnecessary complexity

## Simon Peeters ##

Simon is a linux sysadmin and puppeteer at inuits and focuses on pushing automation in cfgmgmt to the next level.

As a sysadmin (and as a person in general) Simon is inherently lazy and prefers to automate everything.
