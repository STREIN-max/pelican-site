## Relax-and-Recover Automated testing (Gratien D'haese)

elax-and-Recover Automated Testing is a sub-project of Relax-and-Recover to perform fully automated recovery tests without human intervention. This way we can quickly verify every unstable release and test each commit as soon as it fits us.  
Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) is a bare metal Disaster Recovery tool that can save you hours (and sometimes days) to recover a system from scratch in case of failure.
However, for us developers before making a new release it is a real nightmare to test all the different Linux distributions in combination with all the known workflows that ReaR provides. It used to be a manual process of testing the recovery, but we managed to automate the whole process for some workflows.
The testing frame-work itself is build around Ansible, Vagrant, KVM or Oracle VirtualBox, inspec and our own scripts and templates. We will explain the internals of how we do automated testing and we will give a live demo as well.
