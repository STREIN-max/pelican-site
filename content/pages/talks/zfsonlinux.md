## ZFS on Linux: storage beyond volume management and RAID (Wouter Verhelst) ##

The ZFS filesystem, originally written for Solaris and released under
the CDDL, is an advanced filesystem that has been ported to a number of
operating systems, including Linux. It has a number of advanced
features, aimed at improving performance and reliability of the system.

With OpenZFS and zfsonlinux, it is possible to run a ZFS-based system on
most Linux distributions. We will explain how ZFS works, touch on a
number of pitfalls that one might fall into when trying to set up a
ZFS-based system, and how to avoid them.

consultant for the past fifteen years. He has been running a number of
ZFS-based servers since about five years now.
