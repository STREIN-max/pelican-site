## GDPR for Nerds (Frank Louwers) ##

The GDPR will improve the privacy off all EU citizens.
If you don't install the right tool VendorX is trying to sell you, you'll risk a 20 million euro fine.
Everything has to be encrypted by May 25th.
You need to get GDPR certified before you are allowed to touch data.

All of these statements about the GDPR are false. If you want to know
what the GDPR is and is not and how it will impact your life as a
techie, then this presentation is for you :)

## Frank Louwers ##

I have been an IT Expert with business and management experience for
over 15 years. During my studies, I co-founded a Managed Linux hosting
company, grew it from a part-time student-job to one of the top-5
hosting companies in our country, and successfully sold to a European
hosting group.

I am currently working a freelance consultant designing cloud
architectures and SDN/SDWan networks for medium to large organisations
and advising two Cloud SaaS startups.

I am a co-founder of GDPR-butler.eu, an online tool that allows small
organisations to comply with the mandatory paperwork for the GDPR.

My presentation is *not* a sales pitch or demo for GDPR Butler.
