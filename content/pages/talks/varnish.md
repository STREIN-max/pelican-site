## Varnish Internals - Speeding up a site x100 (Mattias Geniar) ##

In this talk we'll look at the internals of Varnish, a reverse proxy with
powerful caching abilities.

We'll walk through an HTTP request end-to-end, manipulate it change it in
ways that no one should ever do in production - but it'll
proof how powerful Varnish can be.

Varnish is a load balancer, caching engine, its own scripting language and
a fun way to deep-dive in to the HTTP protocol.
