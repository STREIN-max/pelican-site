## FreeBSD is not a Linux distribution (Kristof Provost) ##

This presentation introduces the FreeBSD operating system and the community
that produces it.FreeBSD is an advanced computer operating system used to power
modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has
continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking,
security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for
many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and
storage devices.

## Kristof Provost ##

Kristof is a freelance embedded software engineer specialising in network and
video applications. He's a FreeBSD committer, maintainer of pf firewall in 
FreeBSD and a board member of the EuroBSDCon foundation.

Kristof has an unfortunate tendency to stumble into uClibc bugs, and a burning
hatred for FTP. Do not talk to him about IPv6 fragmentation.
