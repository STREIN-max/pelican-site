## Introducing Ansible AWX, the Open Source "Tower" (JP Mens) ##

It's been a while coming: after over a year the product officially known as Ansible AWX has been Open Sourced (this code is the basis for the commercial Ansible Tower).
We introduce AWX, discuss what it is and what it can do for you, talk about how and why you would install it, and we show you how to rid yourself of an aggressive, angry potato.
