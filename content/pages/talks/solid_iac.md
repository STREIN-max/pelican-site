##  Applying SOLID principles to Infrastructure as Code (Bram Vogelaar) ##

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD)
principles by Robert C. Martin, in the early 2000s.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer
to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also
make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily re-factor
code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software
development.

This talk discusses our options how we can model puppet code while
applying the SOLID principles. As the puppet DSL is not a object
oriented language we will also address the limitations of the design
pattern, which we ll have to solve using the convention over
configuration design pattern.
