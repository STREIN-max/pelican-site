# Abstract

Built-in MySQL Replication is known for its capability to enable to scale reads easily. However, there are some limitations and known issues with this solution because of the asynchronous nature of this replication. This talk will describe another way of doing MySQL replication, by using synchronous replication named Galera, available in Percona XtraDB Cluster and MariaDB Galera Cluster.
