# Abstract

Everybody using MySQL/MariaDB/Percona Server, willing or forced to, this is for you!

- I want to achieve High Availability, but I don't know how?
- Is your query cache higher than 128MB?
- How can I scale MySQL?
- Do you think MyISAM is faster than InnoDB? (I'm not saying you are wrong!)
- Do you have performance problems and you don't know how to find the cause?
- Do you think that MySQL is not a serious database?
- Want to get more insight in this black box?
- Do you think MySQL is not a transactional database?

Anything you want, feel free to ask and we'll discuss during this session, for as long as you want and as indepth as you want.
