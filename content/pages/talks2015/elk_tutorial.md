title: ELK stack tutorial
slug: elk_tut
status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract
In this tutorial I would explain the following:

- The big picture
- All the separate components
- A tutorial where we would setup an ELK-stack using vagrant
- Also parsing some standard and maybe non standard log files (apache ,
  syslog, application logs)
- Some general mistakes that people can make
- How to search and visualise in Kibana

**Practical Info:**
People should have vagrant installed (and working !) and I will provide the
boxes and the Vagrant files.
