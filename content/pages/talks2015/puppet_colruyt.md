title: Configuration management at Colruyt: from house-build to pulling strings with Puppet and beyond
status: hidden
slug: puppet_colruyt

# Abstract
Once upon a time, Linux was introduced in Colruyt. In order to manage the diverse environment, our magicians had build their own configuration management system. Fast forward a couple of years, and the magic of that time turned out to have quite some dark spots. Outer world science had also improved, providing better solutions with less work. It time to change the music.

This talk shows where we came from and what we learned. It will talk about the quest to introduce Puppet. It will talk about our rise from infancy to adolescence, with an emphasis on the lessons learned. It will also look forward towards the future, where we hope to tackle some left-overs from the old days and make everything move smoother and safer.
