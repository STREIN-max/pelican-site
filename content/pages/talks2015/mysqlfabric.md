# Abstract
In this presentation we highlight two different ways for scaling MySQL- MySQL
Fabric and MySQL Cluster.
MySQL Cluster provides In-memory Real-Time Performance and provides 99,999% High
Availability for applications demanding high levels of write scalability,
availability and real-time performance.  MySQL Cluster is an ongoing MySQL
development for over a decade with many releases and was just refreshed in
spring 2015 with the new version MySQL Cluster 7.4.
But this is not the only way of providing MySQL for high scaling demands - Since
the introduction of MySQL Fabric in 2014 there's a new way of providing
'scaling' in combination with 'high availability' based on the InnoDB Storage
Engine. We are highlighting both architectures and differences during this
presentation.
