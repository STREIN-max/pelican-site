title: The tale of an Ansible inventory tool
status: hidden
slug: jetfire
category: proposals

# Abstract
When we started using Ansible more and more to manage our infrastructure we
noticed that the standard way of managing Ansible inventories didn't really
fit with how we wanted to use it.
This presentation explains how we started using Ansible, how the tool works
and what might be added to it in the future.

# Bio
